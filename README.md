## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Strings are arrays of characters
  - By appending to a string, the string object is actually destroyed and recreated
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - Memoization: store intermediate results so that they can be reused in another step of the algorithm without the need to be recalculated
- [x] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - Elegant algorithm for anagram detection
  - Figure out the problem solution first and start coding after that

**Arrays**

- [ ] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - Can you memorize one algorithm? What is it?
- [x] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - 
- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - 

**Coding**

- [X] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.
  - http://exercism.io/submissions/94fa019b79be4d39b5cad85544d38e1d
  - http://exercism.io/submissions/6a0f411cad5d4a37bca75cf78eadfb39


### Optional tasks

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
